We are glad to announce that Flare has been published in the proceedings of OSDI 2018. In this paper, we explain the different bottlenecks that keep Spark from achieving the best possible performance. We also explain the different solutions that we implemented in Flare in order to bypass the different issues discovered in Spark, and show that we are on par with the current state-of-the-art database managements, while maintaining the Spark front-end.
