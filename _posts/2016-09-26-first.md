This blog post is the first in a series to introduce Flare, a drop-in accelerator for Apache Spark that delivers (sometimes massive) speedups by compiling queries to native code.

## Query Compilation in Spark 2.0

Performance has been a key focus of the Spark team at Databricks, with impressive gains in 2015 and 2016. Spark 2.0 sports a query engine that compiles entire query stages to JVM bytecode, modeled after best-of-breed query compilers such as TU Munich's HyPer system. **So what is there really to accelerate?**

In this blog post, we take a look at how effective the mechanisms currently implemented in Spark in comparison to hand-written low-level code, and to kill any suspense, we will see that there is still room for improvement.
